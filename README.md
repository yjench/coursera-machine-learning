# Machine Learning

This repo contains my coursework for [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Andrew Ng, Stanford University, on the Coursera platform. The course requires a time investment of about 60 hours.

This course introduces basics of machine learning by using a hands-on approach: it explains the basic concepts, gives intuition on why they work, while touches a minimum amount of mathematics. Students get to familiarize themselves with the concepts through a series of programming assignments.

**⚠️ Note on honor code**

While I try to keep this repo as low-profile as possible, it has been made temporarily public. If you are a currently enrolled student of the course and accidentally stumble into this repo, please take a look at the [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code): please use the contents of this repo only as a reference and don't copy any code.



## Lectures

The topics of this course roughly fall into four categories:

* The first category walks through fundamental components of a learning algorithm and contains a sample of common supervised learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks and support vector machines.
* The second category covers concepts and practical tools to get an machine learning system work well. Examples are concepts of bias and variance, L2 regularization, error metrics, and learning/validation curves.
* The third category includes a selection of common unsupervised learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering, dimensionality reduction and Gaussian mixture models.
* The last category contains miscellaneous topics including how recommender systems work (e.g., content-based models, collaborative filtering), how to perform large-scale machine learning (e.g., variants of gradient descent, online learning and MapReduce) and how a complete machine-learning pipeline looks like (e.g., for OCR).

## Programming assignments

The programming assignments were prepared originally in MATLAB/GNU Octave. However, I completed them using Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment, using interfaces provided by [this fantastic repo](https://github.com/yjench/ml-coursera-python-assignments). In the assignments, one gets to build up various learning algorithms from the scratch in the functional programming style and apply them to solve interesting problems such as image compression. Packages used include `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy` and `re`.

Each directory contains my solutions to each programming assignment (abbrev. PA) in a Jupyter Notebook:
